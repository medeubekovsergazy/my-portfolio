Order Management: Orders progress through the following stages: Accepted → In assembly → On approval → Assembled → Delivered → Completed. Clicking a row opens a detailed order card, allowing product replacement, cancellation, or progression to the next stage via POST requests. 4. Role-based access: - Manager: Full access. - Assembler: Sends orders to the Assembled stage. - Courier: Marks orders as Completed. 5. Shift management: Couriers and assemblers can open/close shifts via the system interface. Integration of third-party services: 1.
